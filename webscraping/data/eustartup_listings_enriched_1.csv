We offer live classes taught by real people, where people teach a subject because they care and know a lot about it.  On PassionClass, years of experience matter more than almost anything else. PassionClass is truly the best place on earth to learn a language.  Duolingo sounds great, but do you know anyone who’s actually learned to speak from an app?  You need classes, group energy, and human connection to get immersed in a language- an opportunity to come and share and exchange and experience, which is what language is truly about.  Our platform fosters this immersive experience, where learners benefit from the dynamic energy of group classes and forge meaningful human connections essential for language proficiency. Yet we offer this for a fraction of the cost of a university, plus, best of all: no grades.  Languages are back to being fun, and PassionClass is more than just learning; it's a platform for sharing, exchanging, and experiencing the essence of language.  � PassionClass is also the best place on the internet to learn new skills.  Want to learn to bake?  Do it here.  Want to learn an instrument?  Get started right away.  Want to share the way you became a chess grandmaster?  On PassionClass, you can use your creativity to teach what you’re most passionate about.  The collaborative nature of our classes not only enhances learning but also makes it a more socially enriching experience- while also saving you money. PassionClass is also a leading platform in the realm of creative arts, providing an unmatched opportunity for individuals to explore and cultivate their artistic talents. Whether aspiring painters, musicians, or writers, PassionClass offers a vibrant space where creators can hone their craft under the guidance of experienced instructors. Group classes in creative arts foster a supportive environment where learners can receive feedback, collaborate with peers, and draw inspiration from diverse perspectives. By combining passion with expertise, PassionClass empowers individuals to unleash their creativity, express themselves authentically, and embark on a transformative journey of artistic discovery. But perhaps the most valuable aspect of PassionClass is the sense of community it fosters. Learning is inherently social, and our platform provides a space for like-minded individuals to connect, collaborate, and support each other.  PassionClass is where you'll find your group: if they’re in a class because they care, then you share interests and maybe a natural connection. A personal tutor can cost $25, $50, $100 or more per hour.  By sharing the cost of instruction on PassionClass, individuals can access high-quality learning experiences at a fraction of the price they would pay for one-on-one sessions, while teachers make real money.

At that time, the sport wasn't that popular and the scene in the region was even smaller. Anton and Mario, both of whom grew up in Leogang, live for the sport of mountain biking. Back then, Anton had never adjusted his mountain bike suspension settings correctly. Mario always helped him with the maintenance and adjustment of the mountain bike. In addition to mountain biking in the Leogang bike park and in the dirt park they built themselves, which was in a friend's garden, they also founded a ""film crew"" with 2 other friends, the ""Lahnvalley Crew"". With this film crew they created videos and photos of themself mountain biking. Many videos and photos were produced and successfully distributed on the web. The scene and the sponsors liked the produced videos, with which the Lahnvalley Crew reached a total of over 1 million viewers online. More and more sponsors were added, such as Alpinestars, SCOTT Sports, MAXXIS Tires and Bikepark Leogang. So they were able to finance their hobby a little out of their own pockets. Anton's settings on the bike also got better and better, thanks to Mario's tips. Mountain bike trips were also financed in this way, including to the mountain bike mecca of Whistler in British Columbia, Canada. Other successful Lahnvalley Crew videos and photos were also created there. After a while, working life became more and more important. But mountain biking remained a hobby. Both made their way into the IT industry. How about a mobile app to improve my suspension setup? This is how the SAGLY project was born, because the passion for the sport was still there. In his home office, Anton worked on new product ideas with a view of the Leogang bike park at home. He then sent Mario a message about what he thought of developing an app to find the ideal mountain bike suspension setting. Of course, Mario was enthusiastic about the idea and the project started. The two find it very exciting to bring technology and innovation into sport. Mario, who has knowledge about mountain bike suspension settings, and Anton, who has software development skills, complement each other perfectly in the project and in August 2021 the first SAGLY version will be available in the app stores. Since then, the app has been continuously developed with user feedback. Why use SAGLY? Mountain bikes are equipped with suspension elements, some of which are associated with quite complex settings. Most mountain bikers have often not optimally adjusted the suspension parts and thus have less riding fun and also endanger their safety. The maintenance of the mountain bike is also often neglected and this also results in more costs. This is exactly why Anton and Mario developed SAGLY. SAGLY helps to finally document, improve and compare mountain bike settings in one place with other riders. The mobile app SAGLY also helps with mountain bike maintenance. Beside a clear interface where you all of your settings are saved, there is also an AI algorithm, SAG Guide, tire air pressure calculator that makes it easy to create a good basic setup. Based on physique, these guides suggest bike settings. All matching parts that the rider has on the bike can also be created. Finally, there is a balance test, with which the user can determine whether his suspension is balanced between the suspension fork and damper. Thus, the user has a good basic setup, which is half the battle when it comes to the settings on the bike. From the basic setup, every mountain bike can then improve the setup at will. The WHAT SHOULD I DO, WHEN... guide gives the user assistance to further improve the setup with the help of SAGLY and their own assessment. SAGLY should by no means be a tool that strictly tells mountain bikers how to adjust their bike. It should help him much more to develop a feeling for his chassis and to find an individual setup based on his own assessment. The FEEDBACK LOOP also helps with this. With this function you can give SAGLY feedback on how you feel about the suspension after the last changes. Recommendations for further adjustments are then given on request. This feature is perhaps a little reminiscent of the bracketing method. This method is used by mountain bike World Cup riders. It basically guides the rider to a great setting by leading him in a certain direction (i.e. clockwise or counterclockwise) by changing a specific setting on the suspension until a point is found for the respective setting at which the rider feels good about the bike. Many terms related to mountain bike suspension are explained in a comprehensible way and with the EXPLORE SETUPS function you can also find other riders' bikes and thus get inspiration of other riders suspension setups and their weight or riding style for good comparison. The suspension settings of other riders can also be tried out and copied into their own setups. In addition, SAGLY is compatible with Strava, so the user can keep an overview of the mileage of the bike and upcoming maintenance. You can easily specify maintenance intervals in the basic setup, which provide the basis for this feature. Through the connection to the Strava account, the mileage or riding hours of the bike are always kept up to date. The progress bars show how long it is until the next maintenance. When maintenance is reached, you will receive a notification from SAGLY so that you do not forget to carry out the maintenance. The HISTORY completes the feature package. Every change to the setup, every added feedback as well as every maintenance or every Strava ride is saved in the HISTORY. This helps to get an overview of the chassis changes or the maintenance that has been carried out or is due. With SAGLY, mountain bikers have a tool in their pocket that they can use to get better at biking overall. You can not only save the suspension settings in SAGLY and compare them with other riders, SAGLY offers much more. A wealth of features paired with an intuitive user interface should help every mountain biker to have more riding fun, more safety and more performance on the bike. Of course, SAGLY should also motivate every rider to show more love for the bike through maintenance and cleaning, thus saving money and preventing serious repairs and damage. With these advantages, the founders are convinced that SAGLY should be on every mountain biker's smartphone. Because not only beginners, but also advanced riders, SAGLY helps to get more out of the bike and thus become a better mountain bike rider. Why are the two founders working on SAGLY? For Anton and Mario, mountain biking is not just a sport, hobby or lifestyle. We associate mountain biking with much more. When mountain biking you experience nature, improve your physical and mental health, get to know other people, feel joy and pleasure, strengthen your will and sometimes learn to get up again. These are just some of the reasons the two think it's worth working on an innovative mobile app like SAGLY. SAGLY technology not only helps you adjust and maintain the mountain bike, but also to experience a passion, mountain biking. Who uses SAGLY and who is the app for? More than 30,000 passionate mountain bikers are now using the app all over the world. Mountain bikers with hardtails but also full-suspension bikes use the app. And no matter if you are a beginner, advanced or professional, the app offers added value for all skill levels. Beginners benefit in particular from the explanations of the sometimes complicated mountain bike suspension know-how and from the guides for the initial suspension adjustment. For beginners and advanced users, the functions WHAT SHOULD I DO, WHEN... or the FEEDBACK LOOP or the HISTORY help to improve the suspension setup to meet their own needs and to constantly improve it. The maintenance feature helps riders of all skill levels extend bike life and save money. Even professionals or semi-professionals benefit from the app and help with the implementation of the bracketing method on the suspension setup. App details and prices SAGLY is available in German and English and PRO features can be activated for an annual (€20) or monthly fee (€2.50). One week test version and basic features such as offline capability, the storage of one bike setup, the EXPLORE SETUPS feature or basic know-how as well as solutions to problems with your setup are available free of charge. SAGLY is available on Apple iOS and Android devices.

Our process is copied from nature; decaying fish and plant leaves collect at the bottom of lakes, and eventually start releasing methane which are eaten by bacteria as they bubble up towards the surface. The bacteria form small protein clumps in their cells which are the natural nutrient feed source for the wild fish. Circular, sustainable protein made from natural gas, (methane) – nature´s cycle and the technological core of Circe´s biomimicry process. Natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and safe extraction and usage techniques have been developed over almost two centuries of extraction experience. Circe is however never complacent and works tirelessly to ensure that the methane, a greenhouse gas, is examined, controlled, and managed at all points of the inbound and processing stages. This is vital as our business´s positive impact on seven of the United Nations Sustainability Goals are the fundamental drivers behind our start up vision and why we do what we do. Circe´s bioreactors are a technological baseline for gas to value solutions using fermentation and have potential application beyond our initial protein targets. Using protein suppression techniques our scientists have been able to develop a process to make the biopolymer PHB (polyhydroxybutyrate) from methane using methanotrophic bacteria. At its most simple level, this is a gas to plastics solution, a polypropylene substitute, but with a huge added advantage of being biodegradable, also in difficult environments like the sea. Combined with the potential to save our oceans from unnecessary overfishing and all the associated oceanic issues of industrial trawling, our humble fermentation technology could eradicate the growing floating plastic islands in our precious waters. Circe is currently designing its first 5,000 litre bioreactor, from which just two more scale jumps will bring us to our final 50,000 litre proof of industrialisation, deployment Q2´23. Multiple units in series will create the first Circe Mega Site in 2024 which will produce 25,000 tonnes of protein per year which if fully substituted for fishmeal would allow 600 million more fish to carry on living in the sea, or prevent the usage of 10,000 hectares of deforested land, every single year.",2019,6,Between €500K-€ 1 million,,(),7,6,9.0,5,7,8,4,469,15,0.25,3,0,"['bioreactor', 'methane', 'sustainable']",B2B,
